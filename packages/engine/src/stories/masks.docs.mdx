Sometimes you want to hide a given input. Suppose a case where you are inputting your password, your credit card number, or even your date of birh.

You might want to hide this input you you `blur` the field or when `changing`.

**4242 4242 4242 4242 -> XXXX XXXX XXXX 4242 -> 4242 4242 4242 4242**

This functionality lets you do this. You can type, and ask to form to hide the input data for you based on your own mask

**NOTES**

- The initial value is formatted

# Generic

Specify your own. This method lets you build your mask

In the following example we will mask one date of birth to be `XX/XX/33`. To do that we are configuring one mask
to put XX from position 1 to position 2 and from position 4 to position 5. The `/` is handled by the `formatters` that is another chapter

```javascript
masks: {
    cleanMask: true,
    onBlur: {
        generic: [
        {
            from: 1,
            to: 2,
            mask: 'X',
        },
        {
            from: 4,
            to: 5,
            mask: 'X',
        },
        ],
    },
}
```

Read the configuration of each generic item

| Key  | type   | Description                                             |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| from | number | The position you want to start masking (non-zero based) |
| to   | number | The position you want the mask to end (non-zero based)  |
| mask | string | The value to put in the specified range                 |

**NOTE: The values are not zero base. Position 1, means 1**
